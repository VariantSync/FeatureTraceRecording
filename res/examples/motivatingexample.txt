- should contain insert, delete (must), move
- insert as first because most easy?
- deleting an already mapped artefact?
- not more than 3 edits? space issues?
- would be great if patterns of eval could be found here because these are hard to grasp (Especially AddIfdefWrapElse would be nice)
- examples for constituent and legator (but could also be in an extra figure)
- no spl techniques such as runtime parameters (too confusing)
- Das Beispiel sollte zeigen warum ASTs hilfreich sind und reine Zeilen doof sind.
