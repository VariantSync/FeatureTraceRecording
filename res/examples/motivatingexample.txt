- should contain insert, delete (must), move
- insert as first because most easy?
- deleting an already mapped artefact?
- variability must be reasonable
- not more than 3 edits? space issues?
- would be great if patterns of eval could be found here because these are hard to grasp (Especially AddIfdefWrapElse would be nice)
- examples for optional and treeoptional (but could also be in an extra figure)
- no spl techniques such as runtime parameters (too confusing)
- Show why ASTs are useful

- entertaining? Show issues everybody ran into

- Ideas:
  -> Carrying some state through some functions. Each feature manipulates the state in a different way?
  -> Compiling with threads enabled


- Classical Features
  -> Log
  -> Profiling
  -> Locking (Thread)
  -> Am I on server or client platform?
  -> Windows vs Linux? (more unreasonable for clone-and-own)
