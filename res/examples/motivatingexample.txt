- should contain insert, delete (must), move
- insert as first because most easy?
- deleting an already mapped artefact?
- not more than 4 edits? space issues?
- would be great if patterns of eval could be found here because these are hard to grasp
- examples for constituent and legator
- no spl techniques such as runtime parameters (too confusing)
