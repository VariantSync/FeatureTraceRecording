{-
Can we resort an edit script?
Assume we have a function that takes an edit script e and generates a dependency graph d.
d should be a directed acyclic graph.
In d, each edit is a node and a directed edge from a to b indicates that a depends on b, i.e., it has to be executed after b.
Then d induces a partial order.
d can be projected onto different total orders.
Each such total order then is one possible resorted edit script.
