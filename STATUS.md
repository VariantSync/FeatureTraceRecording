We claim the _Artifacts Available_ badge as we made our artefacts publicly available on [Github][ftrgithub] and [Zenodo][ftrzenodo]. (For now, the Zenodo link points to a reserved doi under which we will publish the artifacts once completed until the deadline at June 4.)

We claim the _Artifacts Evaluated Reusable_ badge as we implemented feature trace recording as a reusable library.
We documented all modules of the library in detail and made the documentation [available on Github][documentation] as well.
Furthermore, our library serves as a reference implementation if researchers or practitioners want to reimplement feature trace recording in another programming language.
